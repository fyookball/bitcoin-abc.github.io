## Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1 release supports 32MB blocks
 
Bitcoin ABC is excited about the upcoming May 15th Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.
By upgrading to 32MB blocks, we are allowing on chain scaling to continue without
interruption, even as applications such as "memo" are creating massive demand for
blockchain usage.

Bitcoin ABC version 0.17.1 is compatible with the May 15th upgrade.

On behalf of the greater Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community, Bitcoin ABC team wants to make sure everyone is aware of this upgrade.

This is a mandatory (hard fork) upgrade.  All nodes should upgrade immediately to the latest Bitcoin ABC 0.17.1.  To make sure the upgrade goes as smoothly as possible, please make sure to run the latest version 0.17.1 that was released on April 27th.

(Please note “Bitcoin ABC” is not a separate coin. Bitcoin ABC is the leading implementation of Bitcoin Cash.  You can also run compatible software from other teams. )
